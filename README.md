# amaan-weather-app-v1

Hi, welcome to my first attempt at a weather app called the weather spot

This weather app will retrieve the weather of the inputted location and also give the user the option to see the hourly forecast of up to three days if they click on one of the day options

To search up a new location, click on the weather spot logo and it will take you back to the search bar

This app was created using react js, css and html. The api used is the weatherapi and retrieved using axios.

please use npm install to install all packages needed
